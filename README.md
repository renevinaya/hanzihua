# hanzihua
Learning Chinese needs a constant effort, as you are rarely exposed it during daily life. So, I am making a picture frame with an epaper display which shows me Chinese word per day. The words are taken from my flashcard database, which is backed up by my local raspberry pi. Hanzi is Chinese for Chinese letter and hua means drawing.
